To install Docker on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), you can use the official Docker repository. Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. **Update System:**

   Before installing Docker, it's a good idea to update your system's package database:

   ```bash
   sudo yum update
   ```

2. **Install Required Dependencies:**

   Docker requires a few dependencies to be installed. Run the following command to install them:

   ```bash
   sudo yum install -y yum-utils device-mapper-persistent-data lvm2
   ```

3. **Add Docker Repository:**

   Add the Docker repository to your system:

   ```bash
   sudo yum-config-manager --add-repo https://download.docker.com/linux/centos/docker-ce.repo
   ```

4. **Install Docker Engine:**

   Install the latest version of Docker Engine:

   ```bash
   sudo yum install docker-ce
   ```

   This command installs the latest version of Docker Engine and containerd.

5. **Start and Enable Docker:**

   Start the Docker service and enable it to start on boot:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl start docker
   sudo systemctl enable docker
   ```

6. **Verify Installation:**

   Check that Docker has been installed and is running correctly:

   ```bash
   sudo docker --version
   ```

   This command should display the installed version of Docker.

7. **Run a Test Container:**

   You can run a test container to verify that Docker is working as expected. For example, you can run the `hello-world` container:

   ```bash
   sudo docker run hello-world
   ```

   This command will download a test image and run a container that prints a "Hello from Docker!" message.

8. **Manage Docker as a Non-root User (Optional):**

   By default, Docker commands require root privileges. If you want to run Docker commands without `sudo`, you can add your user to the `docker` group:

   ```bash
   sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
   ```

   Log out and log back in, or run the following command to apply the group membership changes:

   ```bash
   newgrp docker
   ```

   After this, you can run Docker commands without `sudo`.

That's it! Docker is now installed and ready to use on your RHEL system. You can start creating and managing containers.
